I think we can attack it from a purely economic angle:
•	Get prices of assets that are typically associated with wealth accumulation (Real Estate, Stocks, Gold)
•	Show that the average person has a lower buying power for those assets since the beginning of the pandemic
•	Forecast this buying power over a couple of years and correlate it to some metrics like Home ownership, retirement age, household dept ratios etc

We could get some pretty dramatic visuals going with this and it could make for a compelling analysis.

The question is framed in the following way: If the COVID pandemic didn't happen, how much better off would be we now?
Is the buying power on long-term assets increasing or decreasing during the COVID?

3.	Establish the typical portfolio of the personas in 2019-2020
a.	Example: the typical 40 years old have 300K investment + a house. 
4.	Forecast this situation for 2 more years and see what the results are
a.	Forecast this buying over a couple of years and correlate it to some metrics like Home ownership, retirement age, household dept ratios, etc.
5.	Write a conclusion about it: is the COVID good for us or not?
