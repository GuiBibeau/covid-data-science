# Real-Estate literature review.

In the process of our data analysis we have decided to establish if the affordability of wealth assets were impacted by the economic shock experienced during the first months of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Since the biggest asset most people will own in their life is their house, we decided to see if the prices of homes would be drastically impacted by the covid-19 crisis.

## Housing prices.

Before assessing afordability it's important to asses prices themselves. Due to the covid-19 being a recent event, most of the available scientific literature was in the form of market reviews and metrics and failed to include extensive polling and gathering of data. One such report we found was the _JLL COVID-19 Global Real Estate Implications Paper II_.

This report was published in the early months of the pandemic and like many similar reports, it failed to include relevant sources and present data sources. The report states facts without sources and gives a disclaimer indicating it is not a complete analysis. For this reason this report sould be discarded from use during our own analysis.

## Housing affordability

In trying to decide if houses were getting less affordable we were able to find a great analysis by RBC on the affordability metrics of the different real-estate markets in Canada. This report named _HOUSING TRENDS AND AFFORDABILITY
December 2020_ focused on analysing different metrics like share of income dedicated to home ownership and analysing on a market per market basis.

The report cites it's sources and used mostly data from Canadian Real Estate Association and RBC Economics but failed to disclose the published source of the data making it hard to access gathering methodology.

The tone of the analysis kept informative and analytial. It made the point that if trends continue most affordability metrics would continue to worsen as incomes seemed to stagnate while house prices were increasing.
