# Stock Market literature review.

In the process of our data analysis we decided to look at the stock market and try identify how the market was impacted during the economic fallout from the COVID-19. Once this was identify we wanted to understand how the market recovered from this situation. Since our data analysis incorporate a forecasting model, it's a must to understand how experts can forecast a stock. 


## What explain the covid-19 stock market

It's important to understand how the stock market recovered from the economic fallout in February and early March. The report called : What exaplin the COVID-19 stock market investigate the role of differnt causal factor in driving the sharp V-shaped trajectory of the US Stock in the early stage of COVID-19. 
The S&P 500 stock market index show a big dip in February and early March 2021, but we can also see it regained most of his lost value. 

The report is talking mostly about the S&P 500, however by comparing the chart with the S&P TSX we see the dip at the exact same place. The authors explain that the market's volatility during the early months of the pandemic is the pricing of stock market risk, driven by big fluctuations in risk aversion or sentiment unrelated to economic fundamentals or interest rates.

They also mention that it's based on an estimated asset pricing model and empirical evidence on the role of Federal Reserve communication in the early months. 

They conclude by saying that these results therefore serve to reinforce the conclusion from the estimated asset pricing model,namely that stock market volatility during the coronavirus pandemic has been driven moreby sentiment than substance.



## Earnings Expectations in the COVID Crisis.

In this paper, they select firms mainly in the NYSE, Nasdaq or AMEX and they retain the top 1000 by total market capitalization as of Dec. 31, 2019. 

They tried to forecast the Earning per sahre (EPS) for fiscal year 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 

What was interesting in this paper, is how the talk about the analyst biases: 
-	Optimist – financial literature documents a positive bias in analyst forecast 
-	Over-reaction and Under-reaction – debate in the behavioral literature is whether stock analyst under-react or over-react to news. This can be applied for COVID-19 news. 

They also investigate the link between forecast revisions and stock returns. I think it was an interesting method, but I feel that the analyst biases mention can have a big impact on the EPS. It also, might be, my lack of knowledge on the topic to connect all the dots together and see what was relevant or not in this paper.
